# Heart-disease-prediction

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. 
1) Data Pre-processing: This section focuses on preparing the heart disease data for analysis. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, handling outliers, and transforming the data if necessary. The dataset has to be in a format that will allow for future analysis.
2) Regression and Classification: In this section, regression and classification techniques will be applied to the pre-processed heart disease data.
3) Ensemble Methods: The final section of the project focuses on employing ensemble methods for predicting heart disease. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. The objective is to increase the overall predictive power for heart disease diagnosis by utilizing the capabilities of various models.

The project seeks to construct efficient models for heart disease prediction and offer insights into the mechanisms influencing heart disease by completing each of these parts.
